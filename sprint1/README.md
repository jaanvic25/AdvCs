<h1>Fourier Transforms and Applications</h1>
<h2>Team Members</h2>
<p>Jaanvi</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I would like to study the topic of fourier transforms (breaking down an image or audio file into simpler components) allowing us to put blurring or smoothing filters, or compress images/audio files. I would like to understand the underlying math and how this topic is necessary for audio and image files and with this knowledge make a basic project such as a program that lets you input an audio file and what factor to compress it by, then shows you how much memory it will take, and how much of its original sound it would retain. Another project idea would be to let the user input an image and have the program break it down into its components then re-draw it with the vectors, depending on how much precision the user wants. Or I could try to apply a blurring or smoothing filter or something like that instead. These would be more tools to show the topic to others or for my understanding rather than for actual use.</p>
<h2>Resources, Are there outside databases or APIs that you think might be helpful?</h2>
<p>Python Libraries: numpy, scipy, matlab, matplotlib, pillow
