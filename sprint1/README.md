<h1>Fourier Transforms and Applications</h1>
<h2>Team Members</h2>
<p>Jaanvi</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I would like to study the topic of fourier transforms (breaking down an image or audio file into simpler components) allowing us to put blurring or smoothing filters, or compress images/audio files. I would like to understand the underlying math and how this topic is necessary for audio and image files and with this knowledge make a basic project such as a program that lets you input an audio file and what factor to compress it by, then shows you how much memory it will take, and how much of its original sound it would retain. Another project idea would be to let the user input an image and have the program break it down into its components then re-draw it with the vectors, depending on how much precision the user wants. Or I could try to apply a blurring or smoothing filter or something like that instead. These would be more tools to show the topic to others or for my understanding rather than for actual use.</p>

<h1>SLAM Algorithm Project</h1>
<h2>Team Members</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I would like to continue something I was working on 2 years ago that mapped out the room surrounding a mini car/ robot using sensors. For example, it would be able to go in a circular room and then recreate that map of a circle to the user.</p>

I would need to use a lidar or some distance sensor and have a mini car of some sort – I could use a chassis from robotics for this. I would also need the electronics to run the mini car.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889009001900 – article that inspired 
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look at different localization and mapping algorithms / methods</li>
<li>Look into clustering and different types of it – distance based, convolutional, etc</li>
<li>Either work on old implementation of it that I made and revisit the paper I based it off of or start new and try to write something for clustering (if I want to use that)
</li>
<li>If not clustering look into other ways of constructing the map around the car</li>
<li>Then look into how to create the lines from clusters</li>
<li>Different mathematical ways, Accuracy tradeoff</li>
<li>While doing that also build? Or find a chassis and set up to use</li>
<li>Test out the lidar or distance sensor </li>
<li>Run test programs to make sure its working as intended
</li>
<li>Test out clustering algorithm with lidar
</li>
<li>Debug
 </li>
<li>Test out the line extraction ones
</li>
<li>If workingish then plot a simple graph to be able to finetune and make the algorithms more accurate or efficient or change completely if graphs show they are not working </li>
<li>Find a way to visualize the map that the car is creating
</li>
</ul>
